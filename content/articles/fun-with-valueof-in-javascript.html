## Fun with `.valueOf()` in JavaScript

July 2nd, 2010

Last week I talked about how I learned to [manipulate javascript's type coercion](/articles/fun-with-tostring-in-javascript) by overriding `.toString()`.  I thought that was the end of my type coercion adventures, but I soon found out that you can mess around with type coercion by overriding `.valueOf()` as well. Here are a couple of examples:

    var a = { valueOf: function() { return 2; } };
    isNaN(a) === false // a is a Number!
    Number(a) // returns 2
    a == 2; // returns true
    a + 3; // returns 5!
    +a; // returns 2
    "2" + a; // returns "22" -- just like a real number! (i.e. "2" + 2 === "22")
{: javascript }

Much of this behavior is a consequence of the [various steps](http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-11.6.1) javascript performs while trying to "add" two elements.  This [question/answer](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2485632) does a particularly good job explaining what's going on.  You may ask, "What's the point of all this silliness?" to which I would reply, "I really don't know... maybe you can make a DSL?" Maybe one like this:

    (function() { // Make numbers look like strings
        var oldToString = Number.prototype.toString;
        Number.prototype.toString = function() {
            if(this == 4) { return "four"; }
            else { return oldToString.call(this); }
        };
    })();
    
    var four = new Number(4);
    alert(1 + four); // shows 5
    alert(four); // shows "four"
    
    (function() { // Make strings look like numbers
        var oldValueOf = String.prototype.valueOf;
        String.prototype.valueOf = function() {
            if(this.toLowerCase() == "five") { return 5; }
            else { return oldValueOf.call(this); }
        };
    })();
    
    var five = new String("five");
    alert(1 + five); // shows 6
    alert(five); // shows "five"
    
    alert(four + five); // shows 9!
{: javascript }

This last example is especially interesting -- a number was returned when a string and a number were "added" together.  Typically a string is returned (e.g. "2" + 2 === "22").  The reason a number was returned instead of a string was because when `four` and `five` were "added" together, the `.valueOf()` method was called on each variable.  Underneath the covers, the `.valueOf()` method was indirectly called by an internal method called [ToPrimitive](http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-9.1).  Since `.valueOf()` returned a number for both variables, the [arithmetic `+`](http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-11.6.3) was used.  The arithmetic version of `+` produced a number, which was ultimately returned as the value of `four + five`.

Admittedly this DSL is quite fragile (e.g. `four !== 4`), but I feel it's a nice showcase of what a little `.toString()` and `.valueOf()` magic can do.
