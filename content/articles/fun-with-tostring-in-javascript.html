## Fun with `.toString()` in JavaScript

June 30, 2010

Implicit type conversion (aka type coercion) is probably the [most dreaded feature in javascript](http://i.imgur.com/Xt2XT.png). It's the reason why `2 + "2" === "22"` while `2 - "2" === 0`.  Like most seasoned js-ers, I've learned how to cope -- sometimes I've even been able to take advantage (e.g. `myBool = !!x`).  After 3 years in the biz, I thought I knew it all, but then javascript gave me a good ol' [ECMA-262](http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-9.1) slap to the face.

About a month ago, I was working on some code and through a series of unfortunate function calls I ended up indexing an array with another array.  Here's a quick example of what I did:

    var gee = [2];
    var emm = ["hi", "bye", "wtf?"];
    
    ohh = emm[gee]; // returns "wtf?"
{: javascript }

The most shocking thing about this code is that it executed without a problem -- how does `emm[[2]]` not throw an error?  I was very confused.  After almost rage quitting my CS career, I decided to take a deeper look.  I eventually discovered that the reason an error wasn't thrown was because `2 == [[2]]`.  This equality held true across every browser I tested.  Still confused and with no other options, I turned to [crowd sourcing](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1724255).

Turns out that when you index an array (or object), javascript implicitly converts the indexer into a string.  In other words, every time you go `foo[bar]`, javascript calls `.toString()` on `bar`.  As a consequence you can do things like this:

    var myFriend = { toString: function() { "my BFF"; } };
    var whoIs = {};
    
    whoIs[myFriend] = "Juanito";
    
    alter(whoIs[myFriend]); // shows "Juanito"
    "my BFF" in whoIs; // true
    myFiend in whoIs; // also true
{: javascript }

All this trickery boils down to the fact that `whosIs[myFriend]` is the same as `whoIs["my BFF"]`.  The wonders of JavaScript are endless...

So what's the point of all this hackery?  Who knows?  Maybe someone will make an awesome DSL using this technique?  At very least another corner of javascript has been revealed.
