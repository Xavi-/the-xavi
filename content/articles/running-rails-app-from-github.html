## Running a Ruby on Rails app from GitHub

January 12, 2011

I'm not a rails developer, but every once in a while I have get a rails app running.  I always forget how to start it, so here's a little reminder.

First make sure Ruby and [RubyGem](http://docs.rubygems.org/read/chapter/3) are installed.  Most OSs (i.e. OSX and Ubuntu) have Ruby preinstalled so this shouldn't be too much trouble.

Once RubyGem is installed, run the following commands to install rails:

    sudo gem update --system
    sudo gem install rails
    sudo gem update rake
    sudo gem update sqlite3-ruby
{: .command-line}

After rails is installed, here are the list of commands to get everything running:

    git clone git://github.com/fancy/pants-app
    cd pants-app
    bundle install
    rake db:setup
    rails server
{: .command-line}

The rails app should now be running.  Just navigate to `localhost:3000` in your browser.  Easy-peasy.
